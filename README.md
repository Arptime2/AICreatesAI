# AI Creates AI (AICAI) - Recursive Code Generation

**AICAI** is a lightweight, efficiency-first CLI tool that leverages small, high-speed Large Language Models (LLMs) hosted on the Groq API to generate, improve, and recursively refine code. It is designed for developers who want to harness the power of AI for practical software engineering tasks without the overhead of large models or complex UIs.

The project's core philosophy is inspired by the recursive, self-improving architecture outlined in the **[ASI-Arch project](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ASI-Arch)**. It demonstrates that even models with limited context windows (â‰¤8K tokens) can produce complex and high-quality output through an iterative process of planning, execution, and refinement.

## Project Overview

This tool is not just another code generator. It's an experiment in applied AI, built on three key principles:

1.  **Efficiency-First**: Implements only what is essential for value creation. The focus is on the core generation loop, not on extraneous features.
2.  **Recursive Improvement**: Uses a continuous feedback loop where the model's output is fed back as input for the next iteration, allowing for progressive enhancement of the code.
3.  **Small Model Optimization**: The entire workflow is designed to maximize the capabilities of small, fast models (like Llama3 8B or Gemma 7B) with limited context windows.

By taking a high-level prompt and optional code, AICAI emulates a developer's thought process: it forms a plan, breaks it down, writes the code, and then refines it.

## Core Functionality

The tool operates in a loop that mimics an advanced reasoning process, making it more powerful than a single-shot prompt.

### The Recursive Loop

1.  **Input**: The user provides a prompt (e.g., "Create a FastAPI endpoint for user authentication") and, optionally, a path to an existing code file to be improved.
2.  **Plan**: The tool sends the initial prompt to the LLM to generate a high-level plan or a list of steps required to fulfill the request.
3.  **Decompose & Execute**: For each step in the plan, the tool generates a specific, context-aware prompt. It sends this prompt along with the relevant code snippets to the LLM to write or modify the code. This decomposition is key to staying within the small context window.
4.  **Refine**: After executing the plan, the tool can run a final refinement pass. It presents the generated code back to the LLM with a prompt to "review and improve this code for clarity, efficiency, and correctness." This self-correction step is critical for quality.

This cycle can be repeated, with each pass building upon the last, to evolve a simple script into a production-ready application.

## Groq API Integration

This tool relies exclusively on the [Groq API](https://groq.com/) for its speed and efficiency.

-   **Authentication**: The tool authenticates using an API key. You must set it as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
    ```

-   **Model Selection**: The tool is hardcoded to use small, fast models (e.g., `llama3-8b-8192`). This is a deliberate design choice to prove the effectiveness of the recursive architecture.

-   **Working with Limited Context**: The tool is architected to handle small context windows effectively. It never sends the entire project's code. Instead, for each step, it sends only:
    - The high-level goal.
    - The specific, decomposed task.
    - The most relevant code snippet (e.g., a single function or class).

This surgical approach ensures that the context is always dense with relevant information, allowing the small model to perform as if it has a much larger understanding of the codebase.

## Architecture Flow: Succeeding with Small Models

The core challenge with small models (e.g., 8B parameters) is their limited context window. They cannot comprehend an entire codebase at once. Our architecture overcomes this by mimicking the focused, iterative workflow of a human developer, inspired by the multi-agent approach of ASI-Arch.

The process is not a single call to an LLM but a structured dialogue orchestrated by our CLI tool. Each step is a targeted, context-specific query.

### How It Works in Detail:

1.  **Phase 1: The Architect (Planning)**
    -   **Input**: The user's high-level goal.
    -   **Persona**: The tool prompts the LLM to act as a *senior architect*.
    -   **Task**: Create a bullet-point plan. For example: "1. Add `fastapi` and `passlib` to requirements. 2. Create a `User` model. 3. Implement a `/token` endpoint."
    -   **Why it works**: This initial step structures the problem without needing to see any code. It establishes a roadmap, which is a task even small models excel at.

2.  **Phase 2: The Coder (Execution Loop)**
    -   **Input**: The plan, the current code state, and *one specific step* from the plan.
    -   **Persona**: The tool prompts the LLM to act as a *focused coder*.
    -   **Task**: "Here is the current code. Now, implement *only* step 2: Create a `User` model."
    -   **Why it works**: This is the key to overcoming the context limit. The LLM is never asked to write the whole application. It is given a very small, manageable chunk of code and one single, isolated instruction. The output of one step becomes the input for the next, building the code incrementally.

3.  **Phase 3: The Reviewer (Refinement)**
    -   **Input**: The complete, generated code from the execution loop.
    -   **Persona**: The tool prompts the LLM to act as a *senior code reviewer*.
    -   **Task**: "Review the following code for bugs, style issues, and potential improvements."
    -   **Why it works**: This final pass allows the model to catch errors or inconsistencies that might have been introduced during the step-by-step generation. It smooths the edges and ensures the final output is coherent and correct.

This structured, multi-persona approach allows a small, fast 8B model to punch far above its weight, producing code that is planned, executed, and reviewed in a process that is more robust than a single, monolithic prompt.


## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aicreatesai.git
    cd aicreatesai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set your API key:**
    ```bash
    export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
    ```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Generate a New Application

Create a simple Flask web server from scratch.

```bash
python main.py --prompt "Create a simple Python web server using Flask that returns 'Hello, World!' on the root path. The server should run on port 5000." --output-file app.py
```

The tool will generate `app.py` with the complete, runnable Flask application.

### 2. Improve an Existing Function

Refactor a function in an existing file for better performance.

```bash
# Assume utils.py contains a slow function:
# def slow_data_processing(data): ...

python main.py --prompt "Refactor the 'slow_data_processing' function to be more efficient and handle potential exceptions." --file utils.py
```

The tool will modify `utils.py` in place, replacing the old function with an improved version.

### 3. Generate a Complex Algorithm

Generate a specific algorithm with requirements.

```bash
python main.py --prompt "Generate a Python function that implements the A* search algorithm. Include comments explaining the main components: the open set, the closed set, and the heuristic function." --output-file a_star.py
```

## Core Components

The codebase is intentionally simple and modular.

-   `main.py`: The CLI entry point. Uses `argparse` to handle user input and orchestrates the overall workflow.
-   `groq_client.py`: A dedicated module for all interactions with the Groq API. Handles request formatting, API calls, and error handling.
-   `recursive_improver.py`: The heart of the tool. Contains the core logic for the Plan -> Decompose -> Execute -> Refine loop.
-   `file_handler.py`: A utility for reading from and writing to files, ensuring safe and predictable file operations.
-   `prompts.py`: A centralized store for all system prompts and prompt templates. Separating prompts from logic makes them easier to tune and improve.

## Design Philosophy: Lean & Powerful

We deliberately avoid features that do not directly contribute to the core mission of recursive code improvement.

**What's Included (The Essentials):**
-   A robust CLI interface for prompts and file paths.
-   The core recursive improvement loop.
-   Clean, readable output to the console and files.
-   Direct and efficient integration with the Groq API.

**What's Not Included (By Design):**
-   A graphical user interface (GUI).
-   Project management or state-tracking features.
-   Support for multiple API providers or models outside of Groq's fast offerings.
-   Complex configuration files.

This lean approach ensures the tool remains fast, maintainable, and focused on its primary goal: making the most out of small models.
