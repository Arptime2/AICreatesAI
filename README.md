# AI Creates AI (AICAI) - Recursive Code Generation

**AICAI** is a lightweight, efficiency-first CLI tool that leverages small, high-speed Large Language Models (LLMs) hosted on the Groq API to generate, improve, and recursively refine code. It is designed for developers who want to harness the power of AI for practical software engineering tasks without the overhead of large models or complex UIs.

The project's core philosophy is inspired by the recursive, self-improving architecture outlined in the **[ASI-Arch project](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ASI-Arch)**. It demonstrates that even models with limited context windows (≤8K tokens) can produce complex and high-quality output through an iterative process of planning, execution, and refinement.

## Project Overview

This tool is not just another code generator. It's an experiment in applied AI, built on three key principles:

1.  **Efficiency-First**: Implements only what is essential for value creation. The focus is on the core generation loop, not on extraneous features.
2.  **Recursive Improvement**: Uses a continuous feedback loop where the model's output is fed back as input for the next iteration, allowing for progressive enhancement of the code.
3.  **Small Model Optimization**: The entire workflow is designed to maximize the capabilities of small, fast models (like Llama3 8B or Gemma 7B) with limited context windows.

By taking a high-level prompt and optional code, AICAI emulates a developer's thought process: it forms a plan, breaks it down, writes the code, and then refines it.

## Core Functionality

The tool operates in a loop that mimics an advanced reasoning process, making it more powerful than a single-shot prompt.

### The Recursive Loop

1.  **Input**: The user provides a prompt (e.g., "Create a FastAPI endpoint for user authentication") and, optionally, a path to an existing code file to be improved.
2.  **Plan**: The tool sends the initial prompt to the LLM to generate a high-level plan or a list of steps required to fulfill the request.
3.  **Decompose & Execute**: For each step in the plan, the tool generates a specific, context-aware prompt. It sends this prompt along with the relevant code snippets to the LLM to write or modify the code. This decomposition is key to staying within the small context window.
4.  **Refine**: After executing the plan, the tool can run a final refinement pass. It presents the generated code back to the LLM with a prompt to "review and improve this code for clarity, efficiency, and correctness." This self-correction step is critical for quality.

This cycle can be repeated, with each pass building upon the last, to evolve a simple script into a production-ready application.

## Groq API Integration

This tool relies exclusively on the [Groq API](https://groq.com/) for its speed and efficiency.

-   **Authentication**: The tool authenticates using an API key. You must set it as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
    ```

-   **Model Selection**: The tool is hardcoded to use small, fast models (e.g., `llama3-8b-8192`). This is a deliberate design choice to prove the effectiveness of the recursive architecture.

-   **Working with Limited Context**: The tool is architected to handle small context windows effectively. It never sends the entire project's code. Instead, for each step, it sends only:
    - The high-level goal.
    - The specific, decomposed task.
    - The most relevant code snippet (e.g., a single function or class).

This surgical approach ensures that the context is always dense with relevant information, allowing the small model to perform as if it has a much larger understanding of the codebase.

## Architecture: Infinite Improvement via Genetic Prompt Optimization

Reactive error correction is not sufficient for true, unbounded improvement. Inspired by the evolutionary mechanisms of advanced AI research and genetic algorithms, this project implements a **Genetic Prompt Optimizer**. This system treats its own operational prompts not as static text, but as **"digital DNA"** to be continuously evolved and improved. The system doesn't just learn from its mistakes; it proactively seeks more intelligent ways to think and work.

This is achieved through a continuous evolutionary cycle:

### The Evolutionary Cycle: A Path to Unbounded Intelligence

1.  **Population Generation:** The system starts by creating a diverse "population" of prompt variations for each of its core personas (`Architect`, `Coder`, `Test Developer`).

2.  **Fitness Evaluation:** Each individual prompt variation is put to the test in the **Autonomous Development Cycle**. It is used to perform a series of benchmark tasks, and its performance is measured.

3.  **Fitness Scoring:** A prompt's success is quantified with a **Fitness Score**, a formula that weighs key performance indicators:
    -   **Task Success:** Did the resulting code pass the self-generated tests?
    -   **Code Quality:** What is the score from static analysis tools?
    -   **Efficiency:** How many resources (time, tokens) were consumed?

4.  **Selection & Breeding:** The highest-scoring prompts—the "fittest" individuals—are selected. The system then uses an LLM to perform genetic operations:
    -   **Crossover:** Combining the "DNA" of two successful prompts to create a new hybrid.
    -   **Mutation:** Introducing small, random changes to a successful prompt to explore new possibilities.

5.  **New Generation:** This new generation of evolved prompts replaces the old one. The single best-performing prompt is used for live tasks while the evolutionary cycle continues in the background, constantly seeking the next breakthrough in performance. This is the engine of infinite improvement.


## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aicreatesai.git
    cd aicreatesai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set your API key:**
    ```bash
    export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
    ```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Generate a New Application

Create a simple Flask web server from scratch.

```bash
python main.py --prompt "Create a simple Python web server using Flask that returns 'Hello, World!' on the root path. The server should run on port 5000." --output-file app.py
```

The tool will generate `app.py` with the complete, runnable Flask application.

### 2. Improve an Existing Function

Refactor a function in an existing file for better performance.

```bash
# Assume utils.py contains a slow function:
# def slow_data_processing(data): ...

python main.py --prompt "Refactor the 'slow_data_processing' function to be more efficient and handle potential exceptions." --file utils.py
```

The tool will modify `utils.py` in place, replacing the old function with an improved version.

### 3. Generate a Complex Algorithm

Generate a specific algorithm with requirements.

```bash
python main.py --prompt "Generate a Python function that implements the A* search algorithm. Include comments explaining the main components: the open set, the closed set, and the heuristic function." --output-file a_star.py
```

## Core Components

The codebase is intentionally simple and modular.

-   `main.py`: The CLI entry point. Uses `argparse` to handle user input and orchestrates the overall workflow.
-   `groq_client.py`: A dedicated module for all interactions with the Groq API. Handles request formatting, API calls, and error handling.
-   `recursive_improver.py`: The heart of the tool. Contains the core logic for the Plan -> Decompose -> Execute -> Refine loop.
-   `file_handler.py`: A utility for reading from and writing to files, ensuring safe and predictable file operations.
-   `prompts.py`: A centralized store for all system prompts and prompt templates. Separating prompts from logic makes them easier to tune and improve.

## Design Philosophy: Lean & Powerful

We deliberately avoid features that do not directly contribute to the core mission of recursive code improvement.

**What's Included (The Essentials):**
-   A robust CLI interface for prompts and file paths.
-   The core recursive improvement loop.
-   Clean, readable output to the console and files.
-   Direct and efficient integration with the Groq API.

**What's Not Included (By Design):**
-   A graphical user interface (GUI).
-   Project management or state-tracking features.
-   Support for multiple API providers or models outside of Groq's fast offerings.
-   Complex configuration files.

This lean approach ensures the tool remains fast, maintainable, and focused on its primary goal: making the most out of small models.
