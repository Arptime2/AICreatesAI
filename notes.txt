# AICAI - Architecture & Functionality Notes (V6)

**Author:** Gemini (Senior Open-Source Engineer)
**Purpose:** This version introduces a critical component for true autonomy: self-generated testing. The system now not only writes code but also writes the tests to validate it, creating a more robust and self-contained improvement cycle.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy: Autonomous Quality Assurance

The previous architectures were still dependent on a human to provide the initial test suite. This is a fundamental limitation. A truly autonomous, infinitely improving system must be responsible for its own quality assurance. It must generate its own hypotheses about correctness (the code) and then generate the experiments to falsify them (the tests).

**The New Core Cycle: `Plan -> Code -> Test -> Execute`**

This represents a major leap in capability. The system now internalizes the complete development workflow.

## 2. Architectural Deep Dive - V6

### 2.1. The New `Test Developer` Persona

This is a new, specialized LLM-based persona that is a peer to the `Coder`.

-   **Role:** An expert in software testing and quality assurance.
-   **Trigger:** Activated immediately after the `Coder` persona successfully generates a piece of code for a given task.
-   **Input:** The user's goal, the specific task from the plan, and the code produced by the `Coder`.
-   **Task:** "You are a senior test developer. Based on the provided goal and code, write a comprehensive unit test using the project's established testing framework (e.g., pytest). The test must cover the primary success case, edge cases, and potential error conditions. Only output the test code."
-   **Output:** A new function or file containing the unit test code.

### 2.2. The Evolved Inner Loop: The Complete Development Cycle

The Inner Loop is now a much more powerful engine.

1.  **`Architect`:** Creates the plan.
2.  **`Coder`:** Implements the code for a single task in the plan.
3.  **`Test Developer`:** Writes a new test for the code just produced.
4.  **`Executor`:** Runs the newly created test. The feedback (pass/fail, stack trace) is now richer because it directly corresponds to a test the system itself conceived.
5.  **`Reviewer`:** Analyzes the code, the new test, and the execution result to provide a holistic critique.

### 2.3. Impact on the Outer Loop (Knowledge Distillation)

The `Strategist` persona now has access to a much richer data stream. It can analyze not just the code's failures but the entire generation and validation process.

-   **New Analysis Capabilities:**
    -   **Poor Test Quality:** If the `Executor` reports that tests are passing but the final application still has bugs, the `Strategist` can infer that the `Test Developer` is writing poor-quality or insufficient tests. It can then update the `Test Developer`'s prompt to be more rigorous.
    -   **Untestable Code:** If the `Test Developer` consistently struggles to write tests for the `Coder`'s output, the `Strategist` can infer that the `Coder` is writing untestable, tightly-coupled code. It can then update the `Coder`'s prompt to emphasize dependency injection, pure functions, and other principles of testable design.

This allows the system to achieve a higher level of abstraction in its learning. It doesn't just learn to fix bugs; it learns to write clean, testable code and to be a more effective tester of that code.

## 3. Visualization V4: The Autonomous Quality Cycle

This new diagram is designed for maximum clarity and visual appeal. It uses a more dynamic, circular flow to represent the core loop and a vibrant color scheme. The fonts are clean and large.

**V4 Diagram Improvements:**
-   **Clarity & Readability:** Large, bold text with a simple, clean layout.
-   **Dynamic Flow:** The left-to-right flow clearly shows the `Code -> Test -> Execute` sequence as the core engine.
-   **Vibrant Colors:** A distinct, high-contrast color is used for each major component, making the architecture easy to parse visually.
-   **Focus on Autonomy:** The diagram places the `Coder` and `Test Developer` in a tight, collaborative loop, emphasizing that the system is responsible for both creation and validation.

This V6 architecture, with its autonomous testing capability, represents a significant step towards a system that can be trusted to improve itself safely and effectively.
