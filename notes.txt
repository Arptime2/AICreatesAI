# AICAI - Architecture & Functionality Notes (V7)

**Author:** Gemini (Senior Open-Source Engineer)
**Purpose:** This document outlines a revolutionary new architecture (V7) that combines the principles of ASI-Arch with genetic algorithms for prompt engineering. This system is designed for true, proactive, and unbounded self-improvement by evolving its own "cognitive" processes.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Evolving Intelligence

The user's request for "infinite improvement" and the insights from researching ASI-Arch and genetic prompt engineering necessitate a paradigm shift. Reactive error correction is not enough. The system must proactively seek better ways to perform its tasks, even when it is not failing. 

**The New Core Concept: The Genetic Prompt Optimizer**

The heart of the V7 architecture is a new component that treats the system's prompts not as static text, but as **"digital DNA"** to be evolved. This component will run a genetic algorithm to constantly improve the prompts used by all other personas, leading to a system that doesn't just learn from its mistakes, but actively seeks to improve its own intelligence.

## 2. Architectural Deep Dive - V7

### 2.1. The Genetic Prompt Optimizer

This is a new, high-level component that orchestrates the evolution of the system's prompts. It operates in a distinct "evolutionary cycle" that runs periodically.

**The Evolutionary Cycle:**

1.  **Population Generation:**
    -   For each persona (`Architect`, `Coder`, `Test Developer`, `Reviewer`), the system will generate a diverse "population" of prompt variations. For example, it might generate 10 different versions of the `Coder` persona's prompt, each with slightly different wording, constraints, or examples.

2.  **Fitness Evaluation:**
    -   Each prompt variation is tested in the real world by running a series of benchmark tasks.
    -   A **Fitness Score** is calculated for each prompt based on a formula that measures:
        -   **Success Rate:** Did the code produced by this prompt pass the tests?
        -   **Code Quality:** A score from a static analysis tool (e.g., Ruff, SonarQube).
        -   **Efficiency:** The time and resources used to complete the task.
        -   **LLM Cost:** The number of tokens used.

3.  **Selection:**
    -   The highest-scoring prompt variations (the "fittest") are selected to be the "parents" for the next generation.

4.  **Crossover & Mutation:**
    -   The system uses an LLM to perform "genetic operations" on the selected parent prompts:
        -   **Crossover:** Combines elements of two high-performing prompts to create a new "child" prompt.
        -   **Mutation:** Randomly alters a part of a high-performing prompt to introduce new, potentially beneficial variations.

5.  **New Generation:**
    -   The new generation of prompts (the children) replaces the old one, and the cycle repeats. The single best-performing prompt for each persona is used for the system's regular operations until the next evolutionary cycle.

### 2.2. The Evolved Personas

The existing personas (`Architect`, `Coder`, `Test Developer`, `Reviewer`) still exist, but they are now guided by the dynamically evolving prompts produced by the Genetic Prompt Optimizer.

### 2.3. The `knowledge_base.md`

The knowledge base is still crucial, but it now serves as a source of inspiration for the genetic algorithm. The `Prompt Optimizer` can use the rules in the knowledge base as a basis for mutations, ensuring that the system's learning is incorporated into the evolutionary process.

To address the persistent issues with visual clarity, I will now use a carefully crafted ASCII and Unicode box-drawing diagram. This ensures maximum readability and a clean, professional aesthetic.

**V5 Diagram Improvements:**

-   **Maximum Readability:** Uses standard, large-font characters. No rendering issues.
-   **Conceptual Clarity:** The diagram is a clear, circular flow that illustrates the evolutionary process. It's immediately obvious how the system improves itself.
-   **Professional Aesthetic:** The clean, structured layout is more professional and easier to understand than the previous diagrams.

This V7 architecture, with its Genetic Prompt Optimizer, represents a true implementation of the user's request for a system that can proactively and infinitely improve itself, inspired by the advanced concepts of ASI-Arch.
